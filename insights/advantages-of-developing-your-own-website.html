                OVERVIEW
              </div>
              <p>
                There are many advantages to coding your own website, rather
                than using a pre-made template or a website builder. Here are
                just a few:
              </p>
              <p>
                Increased control and customization: When you code your own
                website, you have complete control over every aspect of its
                design and functionality. This allows you to create a unique and
                personalized experience for your users. You can also easily make
                changes to your website as your needs evolve.
              </p>
              <p>
                Better performance: Websites that are coded from scratch tend to
                be leaner and more efficient than those built using pre-made
                templates or website builders. This means they will load faster
                and be more responsive, providing a better user experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enhanced security: When you code your own website, you are in
                control of the security measures you put in place. This can help
                to protect your website and your users’ data from potential
                security threats.
              </p>
              <p>
                Improved SEO: Search engine optimization (SEO) is crucial for
                ensuring that your website appears high in search engine
                results. When you code your own website, you can ensure that it
                is optimized for SEO from the ground up, helping to improve its
                visibility and drive more traffic to your site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enhanced credibility: Coding your own website shows that you are
                dedicated and knowledgeable about your business. This can help
                to establish trust and credibility with your users, which is
                essential for building a successful online presence.
              </p>
              <p>
                In conclusion, coding your own website can provide you with
                increased control, better performance, enhanced security,
                improved SEO, and enhanced credibility. While it may require
                some time and effort, the benefits of coding your own website
                are well worth it.d
